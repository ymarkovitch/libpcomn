 DESCRIPTION  :   The abstract input/output layer for the 'zlib' general purpose
                  compression library.
                  Heavily based on gzio.c from the original zlib source distribution

/** Open a compressed stream for reading or writing.
    The mode parameter is as in

    level ("w9") or a strategy: 'f' for filtered data as in "w6f", 'h' for
    Huffman only compression as in "w1h", or 'R' for run-length encoding as in
    "w1R". (See the description of deflateInit2 for more information about the
    strategy parameter.)

    zopen can be used to read a stream which is not in gzip format; in this
    case zread will directly read from the file without decompression.

    zopen returns NULL if the file could not be opened or if there was
    insufficient memory to allocate the (de)compression state; errno
    can be checked to distinguish the two cases (if errno is zero, the
    zlib error is Z_MEM_ERROR).
